/* eslint-disable no-unused-vars */

/**
 * Use one const declaration per variable.
 * Why? It's easier to add new variable declarations this way, and you never
 * have to worry about swapping out a ; for a , or introducing punctuation-only diffs.
 * You can also step through each declaration with the debugger, instead of jumping
 * through all of them at once.
